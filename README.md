Repo currently includes processed transcriptome data in data/ folder

als_notebook.ipynb includes an autoencoder neural network and some ML/Stats stuff at the bottom

Some minor notes, data is definitely nonlinear. 

The amount of features makes it difficult to create a model that does not overfit.

Additionally, class imbalance for als vs. no als also makes the task a bit more difficult (class weights are included in the notebook).
